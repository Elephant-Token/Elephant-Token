    Hello, Iâ€™m I am the Developer and founder of ElephantToken(ELE)
 im interested in just about everything, video games, sports,tv bikes. i have kids , i have a little farm in united states.
 im a pretty chill laid back-back kind of guy. i like working,i don't see how anyone likes to not work, its relaxing and
 keeps your mind busy and you get a workout!
 I created ElephantToken because my wife inspired me to do it, she absolutely loves these big creatures, i found my self liking them just
 as much.that is why, i started this project, to help these animals.
    i am currently learning how to make video games, i have produced 3 games that are out on google play, just search xXliteGamingXx and 3 games will appear
 i am interested in other projects to partner up with and help save our animals that are now going extinct, it won't be much longer
 because asian and african elephants are pretty scare. its sad that these people just poach these animals for trophys, and sport.
 if anyone is interested in speaking with me on the project or would like to partner up, don't hesitate to contact me 
 at David3239294@gmail.com.
 thanks

ElephantToken is a hyper deflationary token on the binance smart chain.
